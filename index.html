<p><strong>Abstract</strong><a name="Abstract"></a><br>
  Hurricane Humberto (2007) underwent a rapid intensity change as it developed 
  from a tropical depression 0900 UTC on 12 September to a small category 1 hurricane 
  at 0600 UTC on 13 September, making landfall an hour later near High Island, 
  Texas. In a twenty-one hour time span, Humberto's winds increased from 25 knots 
  to 80 knots, a higher intensification rate than any other observed tropical 
  system making landfall. Based on the synoptic-scale environment for Hurricane 
  Humberto set by Kaplan and DeMaria (2003) of low wind-shear, high relative humidity 
  values in the lower atmosphere, warm sea surface temperatures, and strong 12-hour 
  intensity changes, conditions were found to be very favorable for rapid intensification. 
</p>
<p><strong>Introduction </strong><a name="Intro"></a><br>
  As hurricane track forecasting accuracy has improved with newer models, forecasting 
  the intensity of tropical storms has lagged behind. Hurricane Humberto (2007) 
  was a prime example of this. &#8220;No reliable model ever [forecasted Humberto] 
  to reach hurricane strength,&#8221; and despite only reaching Category 1 status 
  on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was a record-setting storm (Blake 2007). Its 
  intensification of 55 knots in a period of 21 hours prior to landfall in southeastern 
  Texas was unmatched by any tropical system making landfall on record, and one 
  of four storms (Celia in 1970; Arlene and Flora in 1963) to intensify so rapidly 
  from a subtropical storm in a 24 hour period (Blake 2007).<br>
  At 0600 UTC on 12 September, a cold front spawned a weak surface low in the 
  Northwestern Gulf of Mexico, becoming Tropical Depression Nine (with 25 knot 
  winds) at 0900 UTC (Blake 2007). Tropical Storm Humberto was formed at 1200 
  UTC, and by 0400 UTC on 13 September, it reached Category 1 status. At 0600 
  UTC, Humberto reached its peak intensity with sustained winds of 80 knots and 
  a minimum pressure of 985 mb, making landfall an hour later near High Island, 
  Texas. National Hurricane Center forecaster Franklin commented on this increase 
  of 55 knots in 21 hours*: </p>
<blockquote>
<p> &#8220;To put this development in perspective&#8230;No tropical cyclone 
    in the historical record has ever reached this intensity at a faster rate 
    near landfall&#8230;It would be nice to know&#8230;someday&#8230;why this 
    happened&#8221; (2007).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"> The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of the synoptic 
  features that played a factor in Humberto&#8217;s intensification, and attempt 
  to determine the cause. DeMaria and Kaplan (2003) conducted research into Atlantic 
  tropical cyclones, and found that with small storms such as Humberto, environments 
  with lower upper-level ascent and divergence, lower-level moisture content, 
  warm sea-surface temperatures, and weak vertical shear have the largest 48-hour 
  intensification rates. These values will be analyzed, along with satellite data 
  and observations.<br>
</p>
<p align="left"><strong> Background</strong><a name="Background"></a><br>
  Tropical cyclones are often intense surface lows, whose energy source is the 
  oceanic waters. Hurricanes require a set of synoptic conditions to be met in 
  order to maintain their intensity, or to allow for further intensification. 
  Warm sea surface temperatures (and warm-water upwelling) allow for the air above 
  the warm waters to become unstable, further driving convection. This process 
  has been long studied, such as in the case of Hurricane Katrina (2005), where 
  anomalously warm Gulf waters where determined to play a significant role in 
  the intensification of the storm (Kafatos et al. 2006). A low amount of shearing 
  is needed to create the &#8220;ventilation effect&#8221;, as coined by Gray 
  (1968), which is crucial for deep convection and the formation of the eyewall. 
  Without a significant level of vertical shear, this deep convection allows for 
  a positive feedback loop between latent heat release (through condensation) 
  and updrafts near the center of the storm, further strengthening the convection 
  and eyewall. Because of this, an original source of instability, a high amount 
  of low-level moisture, and a convectively unstable (to neutral, in some cases) 
  atmosphere are also needed. Corolis force gives the hurricane rotation, allows 
  for incoming air to be blown towards the surface low, and also produces an upper-level 
  high pressure for the diverging air aloft. Interactions between a tropical system 
  and synoptic features in its environment, such as an upper-level jet increasing 
  divergence in Hurricane Opal (1995) (Bosart et al. 2000) or the mean synoptic 
  flow&#8217;s interaction with the outflow of a tropical system (Merrill 1988), 
  have also been studied.</p>
<p align="left"> John Kaplan and Mark DeMaria developed the Statistical Hurricane 
  Intensity Prediction Scheme (hereinafter referred as SHIPS) to examine the synoptic 
  characteristics of every Atlantic Basin tropical system (from non-developing 
  depressions to hurricanes; excludes any time in which a storm was over land 
  for more than one hour) between 1989 and 2000, with data in 12-hour increments 
  (2003). From these studies, a surface wind increase of 30 knots over a 24-hour 
  period was proposed as the definition of a rapidly intensifying cyclone (Kaplan 
  and DeMaria, 2003). The 2005 (DeMaria et al.) revision attempted to deal with 
  newer models, satellite data, and included a decay model for hurricanes that 
  were over land for over one hour (but re-emerged over a body of water), as these 
  were exempt from the previous SHIPS study. With that in mind, it is important 
  to note that Hurricane Humberto does not fall under this category. Systems making 
  landfall and dissipating over land without re-emergence over a body of water 
  were not included in the SHIPS study.</p>
<p align="left"> Kaplan and Demaria (2003) concluded that the most statistically 
  important parameters (and threshold values) for calculating rapid intensification 
  are low wind-shear, high relative humidity values in the lower atmosphere (69.7% 
  in the 850-700 mb layer), warm sea surface temperatures (28.4&deg;C), the difference 
  in current intensity and maximum potential intensity (47.6 m/s), and intensity 
  changes in the sustained surface winds (+4.6 meters per second, or +8.9 knots, 
  in the previous 12 hours). Because of a time constraint, this paper will not 
  be able to look at the current and maximum potential intensities, and will analyze 
  the remaining four parameters. <br>
  Research done by Yang et al. (2007) further narrowed down Kaplan and Demaria&#8217;s 
  (2003) list of statistically important parameters to 12-hour intensity change, 
  vertical wind shear in the 850 to 200 mb layer, and the relative humidity of 
  the 850 to 700 mb layer. In the original 1989-2000 period, the probability of 
  a cyclone (meeting the thresholds of these three variables) undergoing rapid 
  intensification increases 4.1% to 47.6%, compared to 43.5% while also including 
  the potential of the storm and sea surface temperatures (Yang et al. 2007).<br>

<p align="left"><strong>Data</strong><a name="Data"></a><br>
  The National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecasting System 
  (GFS) model data provided by Unidata will be used for this case study. Data 
  was obtained from the Iowa State Environmental Mesonet. Initialized (forecast 
  hour 0) runs were studied to best depict the synoptic environment. The 4-km 
  infrared satellite observations come from the Geostationary Operational Environmental 
  Satellite (GOES) 12 spacecraft, ran by the Office of Satellite Operations (OSO) 
  at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). High Resolution 
  Sea Surface Temperature (SST) imagery was provided by the Ocean Remote Sensing 
  Group in the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Additional 
  SST was provided by NCEP. The &#8220;real-track&#8221; data of Hurricane Humberto 
  will be provided from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) Tropical Cyclone Report 
  (TCR). Commentary from the NHC Forecast Discussions will be used, but numerical 
  values will not be used from this source, as the TCR times are earlier than 
  those from the Forecast Discussions and Advisories.<br>

  At 0000 UTC on 12 September, a cold front was passing over the Deep South with 
  a line of thunderstorms (Fig. 1). The upper level jet was over the Great Lakes 
  (Fig 2.) and did not move towards the South (Figs. 3 and 4). In a previous case 
  of Hurricane Opal (1995), an upper jet-trough-hurricane interaction was concluded 
  in providing a major role in the storm&#8217;s rapid intensification (Bosart 
  et al. 2000).</p>

      Humberto had an &#8220;unusually well-defined banding and core convective 
      structure&#8221; prior to its formation, which the Tropical Hurricane Center 
      researchers suggest as a main source for its rapid intensification (Blake 
      2007). It was also a small storm, with tropical storm force winds &#8220;never 
      exceeding 50 [nautical miles]&#8221; based on Dvorak technique intensity 
      estimates (Blake 2007). The coldest cloud tops near the time of maximum 
      storm intensity (0645 UTC) were north of the center of rotation, with temperatures 
      near -76&deg;C (Fig. 6). Cold cloud tops correlate to higher, deeper clouds, 
      which relates to higher precipitation rates, deeper convection, and stronger 
      winds.</td>

  On 12 September, the sea surface temperatures of the Gulf of Mexico were over 
  29&deg;C (302&deg;K) (Figs. 7 and 8), with a warmer pool of 30&deg;C water along 
  the extreme southeastern Texas coast through the Florida Keys. This exceeds 
  the minimum threshold established for rapidly intensifying tropical cyclone 
  development by Kaplan and Demaria (2003) of 28.4&deg;C by approximately one 
  to two degrees. A one degree Celsius increase in SST can lead to an increase 
  in central storm pressure of between 12 and 14 mb (Kafatos et al. 2006). A warm 
  Gulf eddy, such as the one along the Texas and Louisiana coastline, was a factor 
  in the rapid intensification of Hurricane Opal (Bosart et al. 2000). </p>

        time, the vertical wind shear in the 850 to 200 mb layer along the entire 
        Texas and Louisiana coast and in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (an area 
        extending roughly between 25-30&deg;N and 98-90&deg;W) was below 4 m/s

        mb heights was over 70% (except immediately inland of the Texas coast), 
        with a maximum of over 90% near the center of convection (Fig 9). Even 
        though &#8220;almost all thunderstorm activity has dissipated with the 
        low&#8221; at 0300 UTC, likely due to the lack of energy via solar heating, 
        these conditions brought about a very favorable environment for a rapid

        enough convection to classify it as Tropical Depression Nine (Blake 2007).

  A stalled cold front gave enough convection to form the ninth tropical system 
  of the 2007 hurricane season early on 12 September. In twenty-seven hours, the 
  storm made landfall near High Island, Texas, as a Category 1 Hurricane. Hurricane 
  Humberto intensified on a record-setting scale of 55 knots in 21 hours between 
  its initial formation and its maximum intensity, just prior to landfall. Humberto 
  is just one example showing the difficulty in forecasting rapid intensification 
  of tropical cyclones. The synoptic environmental parameters, deemed most influential 
  for this meteorological bombing by Kaplan and Demaria (2003), were determined 
  to be very favorable for the development that occurred. Low vertical wind shear, 
  ample lower-level moisture, and warm sea surface temperatures allowed for Hurricane 
  Humberto to develop literally overnight.</p>
